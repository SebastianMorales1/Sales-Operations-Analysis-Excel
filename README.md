# Portfolio Project: Sales & Commissions Analysis with Excel

## Project Overview
# This project is a **professional simulation** designed to demonstrate advanced Excel capabilities in a business environment, specifically focusing on logistics and sales operations. The objective was to transform a raw dataset of 14,000+ records into an actionable tool for calculating sales commissions and analyzing regional performance.

## 🛠️ Skills & Functions Demonstrated
- **Data Cross-Referencing:** Implementation of `VLOOKUP` and `HLOOKUP` to automate the retrieval of pricing and agent information.
- **Business Logic:** Use of logical functions (`IF`, `AND`, `OR`) to establish tiered commission structures based on sales modality (Phone, Web, Live).
- **Data Integrity:** Applied data cleaning techniques (deduplication, text-to-columns, and data validation) to ensure accurate reporting.
- **Reporting & Visualization:** Creation of **Pivot Tables** and **Slicers** to summarize sales by region and identify top-performing agents.

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `Excel_Portfolio_Sebastian_Morales.xlsx`: Main workbook containing raw data, calculation engines, and summary reports.
- `README.md`: Project documentation and business context.

## 🎯 Key Takeaways (Simulated Results)
- Successfully automated a complex commission model, reducing manual calculation errors.
- Visualized regional sales distribution, highlighting the "Web" modality as a key growth area.
- Developed a scalable template that can handle large datasets for logistics reporting.
